SparkleShare, an open source file synchronization tool similar to Dropbox, has been updated to version 1.1.0 recently, receiving numerous bug fixes and tweaks.

SparkleShare is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OSX and it uses GIT version control under the hood so setting up a host should be pretty easy and also, it supports some code hosting services out of the box, such as GitHub, Bitbucket or Gitorious.

SparkleShare 1.1.0, released recently, includes the following bug fixes and tweaks:
new plugin for plan.io, a project management platform
Work with host keys other than just RSA
Stricter permissions on the SparkleShare folder on Unix systems
Use large message tray icon on GNOME 3 (though due to packaging probably, the PPA builds don't have this yet)
Don't show notifications for changes that you made yourself
"%20" and "_" in project names become spaces in folder names
Open folders in the event log by clicking project names
Allow spaces in passwords
Change invite scheme to sparkleshare://addProject/$URL
Fixed retina Mac support
Don't sync files with names that are problematic on Windows
Show Client ID (link code) in the status icon menu
Added a plugin for plan.io
Many other bug fixes and tweaks


<h2>Install SparkleShare in Ubuntu</h2>

Ubuntu users can install the latest SparkleShare by using a (unofficial) PPA. To install Sparkleshare in Ubuntu, firstly you must add the GIT PPA (the SparkleShare PPA depends on it):
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa

Then you can proceed to installing SparkleShare:
<pre class="linux-code"><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rebuntu16/sparkleshare+unofficial
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sparkleshare libmono-posix4.0-cil</code></pre>

Once installed, you can add a hosted project by selecting "Add hosted project" from the tray / appindicator menu, then select the service: Bitbucket, Github, Gitorious or Plan.io (it shows up as Gitorious for some reason).
