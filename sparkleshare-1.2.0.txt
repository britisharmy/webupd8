SparkleShare is a cloud collaboration/synchronization tool that uses Git and can either be used with your own Git repository or you can use it with services such as BitBucket, GitHub, Gitorious and Planio.


The application features file synchronization, version control, client side encryption and more and is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. According to its homepage, SparkleShare and is great for frequently changing project files like text, office documents and so on, but not for large music/photo collections, large binary files hat change often and so on (because it uses Git which doesn't handle binaries very well).
