SparkleShare is an open source file synchronization and collaboration tool somewhat similar to Dropbox, available for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.

SparkleShare uses GIT version control system and can be used with code hosting services like GitHub, Bitbucket or Gitorious as well as your own server.

SparkleShare features:

presets for projects hosted on GitHub, Bitbucket or Gitorious
a recent changes window shows who changed what
restore deleted files or revert to previous versions
conflict handling
notifications
client side encryption
optional Ubuntu AppIndicator

There's also Nautilus integration on Linux (there's no mention of this on its website, so I don't know if there's integration for Windows and Mac OSX too), but unfortunately it doesn't work with Nautilus 3.6.



<h2>Install SparkleShare 1.0 in Ubuntu</h2>

SparkleShare 1.0 will most probably be available in the official Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail repositories, but it can easily be installed on older Ubuntu versions by using an unofficial PPA.

To install SparkleShare 1.0 in Ubuntu 12.10, 12.04 or 11.10, firstly add the  Git stable releases PPA (the Sparkleshare PPA below depends on this PPA):
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt-get update

Then, add the unofficial SparkleShare PPA and install the latest SparkleShare 1.0 in Ubuntu 12.10, 12.04 or 11.10 using the following commands:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rebuntu16/sparkleshare+unofficial
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sparkleshare libwebkit1.1-cil

<b>Important: the Ubuntu appindicator icon won't show up unless you're using the "ubuntu-mono-dark" (the default Ubuntu icon theme) or "ubuntu-mono-light) icon theme!</b>

Once installed, launch SparkleShare and follow the initial setup dialog steps. 


Adding a project hosted on GitHub, etc. is very easy: SparkleShare will create a text file with a ssh key in the SparkleShare folder which you need to add to GitHub under https://github.com/settings/ssh . If you've already added your own ssh key to GitHub, SparkleShare can use that instead, without any extra setup so just enter the remote path and you're ready:


If you want to set up your own host, there's a script you can use which configures everything for you - see the SparkleShare <a href="http://sparkleshare.org/">homepage</a> for more info on this.

For other Linux distributions, Windows and Mac OSX, download SparkleShare from its <a href="http://sparkleshare.org/">homepage</a>.
